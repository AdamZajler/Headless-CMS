# Headless CMS
This is my second try to create a headless CMS site based on Wordpress. My main goal is to learn some stuff [ ;) ] and make this site multilangual by using Polylang & Next Translate Routes

## Table of content
- [Installation](#installation)
  - [Local&trade; envirotment setup](#local-envirotment-setup)
  - Getting started with repository

## Installation
This step is splited in to two sections. 
First is to set-up Local&trade; by flywheel local wordpress envirotment, and the second part is to paste repository & change a few elements :) 

### Local&trade; envirotment setup
1. [download](https://localwp.com/releases/) Local&trade; by flywheel & install it on your desktop.
2. Install it (if you need help I recommend to follow [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/tkf0fbrttsU?t=109)
3. Create new installation:
  - click "+" button
  - select "Create a new site"
  - give it name; for ex. "WordPress" | don't change anything in "Advanced options"
  - select "Preferred" settings for PHP etc.
  - create Wordpress username & password & email (those will be nessecary to login into wp-admin). I suggest to pass "admin", "123", "[your-common-used @ email.com]"
  
4. After install, click "Go to site folder" under your installation title
